##Experience as developer
###Software Engineer, Venntro Media Group: May 2014 to Present

Venntro runs a dating platform with tens of millions of members.

I am employed as a Ruby specialist. Ruby is one of the main programming languages used at the company: about 70 Ruby apps and services help power the platform and the mobile web app is written in Ruby.

I joined as ‘junior software engineer’ and after a year was promoted to ‘software engineer’.

* major new feature which communicates with 6 internal services, for the high-traffic mobile web app
* gem which is source for owning-company data across the platform
* Active Merchant plugin for processing payments at new payment gateway

Some examples of software I have co-written:
* green-field Sinatra app for processing mobile payments
* standalone app which fetches from a 3rd party API multiple pieces of data for each of 6 million emails the business sends per day, and stores this data for graphing
* two major functionality upgrades to the app which is the platform's main communicator with external payment providers

My day-to-day work has involved:

* Working within environment organised around services and microservices
* Use of REST APIs and RabbitMQ for communication between services
* Optimising complex MySQL queries on database tables containing multi-million records
* Working to the exacting standards needed for payment systems
* Ensuring good test coverage for all code written as a default
* Working in a multi-disciplinary scrum-team using Agile process

##Summary of career up to 2013
After an undergraduate degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics, I pursued a variety of challenges in my twenties. I worked for a TV production company and an internet startup. I also lived in Japan for a three year period, by the end of which I was working as a translator. Subsequently, I trained as a lawyer. Following law school from 2007 to 2009, I worked predominantly as an employment lawyer for the next 4 years, until the worst legal recruitment market in living memory pushed me towards a career in software development: something which, fortuitously, has worked out incredibly well. My prior experiences helped me hone a whole raft of transferable skills - including those relating to diligence, equanimity, precision, strategic thinking and communication skills - which I have been able to draw on extensively in my transition to becoming a professional software developer.


##Experience in law
####Employment Advisor at Abbey Protection Group, Croydon: 2013
Worked at this litigation insurance company in employment law advice call-centre. Qualified solicitor role, but overriding focus on quantity of callers dealt with. Good experience in a variety of ways, but not a long-term destination.

####Paralegal at Pattinson & Brewer Solicitors, London: 2011-2012
Daily duties included drafting witness statements and schedules of loss, writing detailed instructions to experts and to barristers, and liaising with clients and experts. Experience here, added to previous role, enabled completion in August 2012 of QLTR regulations' “different seat” requirements for qualification as a solicitor.

####Advocate at Employment Law Advocates, London: 2009-2011
Acted as 'trial lawyer' for employment tribunal claims. Responsible for resolving disputes, through negotiation or tribunal hearing. Largest case: acted for client company with annual turnover of £100 million against 3 claimants in 4-day unfair dismissal/constructive dismissal hearing.
