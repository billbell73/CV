##Since Makers Academy at end of last year

Since Makers Academy I have been coding pretty much every day. I have furthered my studies in various ways including by working my way through the following excellent books: [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/),  [HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) and [Agile Web Development with Rails 4](http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails-4), and by traversing the [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/) archive. I have also learnt how to test and build basic projects in AngularJS having studied the [Thinkster.io curriculum](http://www.thinkster.io/angularjs/GtaQ0oMGIl/a-better-way-to-learn-angularjs). As a guest, I attended the *Mint Challenge* - an away-week with my brother's company [Mint Digital](http://mintdigital.com/) - for which the company split into 3 teams with the aim being to come up with a number of new products in a week. During this I contributed to a Rails app and also wrote the *mail_sender* ruby script listed above. 

##Makers Academy &mdash; September - December 2013
* Highly selective web development bootcamp
* Object oriented programming and software design
* Full stack web development, with focus on Ruby on Rails
* Emphasis on TDD and pair programming

##Career-change motivation
In 2013 I found myself unable to obtain work - despite being a qualified lawyer with a good resume - because of the worst recruitment market in living memory, caused by a series of structural shifts in the legal industry. Though at the time this seemed like a personal calamity, I have come to see it as stroke of disguised good fortune. In my opinion, many of the best lawyers would make excellent software developers and most of those would have more fun and have less stressful careers were they to decide to make the change.

##Summary of career up to 2013

After an undergraduate degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics, I pursued a variety of challenges in my twenties. I worked for a TV production company, an internet startup and I also lived in Japan for 3 years. Then, I qualified as a lawyer. Following law school in 2007 - 2009, I worked predominantly as an employment lawyer for the subsequent 4 years. This experience has helped me hone a whole raft of transferable skills - including those relating to diligence, precision, strategic thinking and communications skills - which I have already been able to draw on extensively in my transition to becoming a software developer.
